This is a web application for real-time collection of geolocation data, tracks viewing and management.
Together with a dedicated [μlogger mobile client](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/ulogger-android) it may be used as a complete self hosted server–client solution for logging and monitoring users' geolocation.
